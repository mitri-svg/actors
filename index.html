    <h1 class="q1">Sylvester Stallone
        <hr>
    </h1>
    <div class="w1">
        <p>In 1977, Stallone was the third actor in cinema to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original
            Screenplay and Best Actor. Stallone's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry, and had its
            props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallone's use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of
            Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of the Rocky
            character placed permanently near the museum, and he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.
            Up until 1982, Stallone's films were not big box-office successes unless they were Rocky sequels, and none
            received the critical acclaim achieved with the first Rocky. This changed with the successful action film
            First Blood in which he portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo. Stallone would play the role in a
            total of five Rambo films (1982–2019). From the mid-1980s through to the late 1990s, Stallone would go on to
            become one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors of that era by appearing in a slew of commercially successful
            action films which were however generally panned by critics. These include Cobra, Tango and Cash,
            Cliffhanger, the better received Demolition Man, and The Specialist.

            Stallone saw a decline in popularity in the early 2000s but rebounded back to prominence in 2006 with a
            sixth installment in the Rocky series and 2008 with a fourth in the Rambo series. In the 2010s, Stallone
            launched The Expendables films series (2010–present), in which he played the lead as the mercenary Barney
            Ross. In 2013, he starred in the successful Escape Plan, and acted in its sequels. In 2015, Stallone
            returned to the Rocky series with Creed, that serve as spin-off films focusing on Adonis "Donnie" Creed
            played by Michael B. Jordan, the son of the ill-fated boxer Apollo Creed, to whom the long-retired Rocky is
            a mentor. Reprising the role brought Stallone praise, and his first Golden Globe award for the first Creed,
            as well as a third Oscar nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior. Since
            2022, he has starred in the television series Tulsa King for Paramount+.

            Stallone is the only actor in the history of American cinema to have starred in a box-office number-one film
            across six consecutive decades.[6][7]</p>

            Gardenzio Stallone[2][3][4] (/stəˈloʊn/; born July 6, 1946) is an American actor and
            filmmaker. After his beginnings as a struggling actor for a number of years upon arriving to New York City
            in 1969 and later Hollywood in 1974, he won his first critical acclaim as an actor for his co-starring role
            as Stanley Rosiello in The Lords of Flatbush. Stallone subsequently found gradual work as an extra or side
            character in films with a sizable budget until he achieved his greatest critical.

    <h1 class="q1 b1">Arnold Schwarzenegger
        <hr>
    </h1>
    <div class="w2"><p>Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at age 15 and won the Mr. Universe title aged 20, and subsequently the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time,[7][8] and has written many books and articles about it.[9] The Arnold Sports Festival, considered the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him.[10] He appeared in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977). He retired from bodybuilding and gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian (1982),[11] a box-office hit with a sequel in 1984.[12] After playing the title character in the science fiction film The Terminator (1984), he starred in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and three other sequels. His other successful action films included Commando (1985), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), Total Recall (1990), and True Lies (1994), in addition to comedy films such as Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Jingle All the Way (1996).[13] He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions.[14]

        As a registered Republican, Schwarzenegger chaired the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports during most of the George H. W. Bush administration. On October 7, 2003, he was elected Governor of California in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He received 48.6% of the vote, 17 points ahead of Democrat runner-up Cruz Bustamante. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis' term, and was reelected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election with an increased vote share of 55.9% to serve a full term.[15] In 2011 he reached his term limit as governor and returned to acting.
        
        Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" or "Schwarzy" during his acting career,[16] and "the Governator" (a portmanteau of "Governor" and "Terminator") during his political career. He married Maria Shriver, a niece of President John F. Kennedy, in 1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in 1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021.[17]</p></div>
